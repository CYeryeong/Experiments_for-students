Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository! This guide will help you add your own experiments.

## How to Add an Experiment

### Step 1: Create a New Directory
Create a new directory under `experiments/` with a descriptive name for your experiment:
```bash
mkdir experiments/your_experiment_name
```

### Step 2: Use the Template
Copy the experiment template to your new directory:
```bash
cp experiments/templates/experiment_template.md experiments/your_experiment_name/README.md
```

### Step 3: Fill in the Details
Edit the README.md file in your experiment directory and fill in all sections:
- **Objective**: What is the goal?
- **Background**: What theory or context is needed?
- **Materials**: What tools, software, or materials are required?
- **Procedure**: Step-by-step instructions
