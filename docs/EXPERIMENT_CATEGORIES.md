## How to Use This Guide

When creating a new experiment, consider which category it fits into. You can organize your experiments by creating subdirectories within the `experiments/` folder based on these categories.

Example structure:
```
experiments/
  ├── programming_fundamentals/
  │   ├── variables_demo/
  │   └── loops_practice/
  ├── data_structures/
  │   ├── linked_list/
  │   └── binary_tree/
  └── algorithms/
      ├── bubble_sort/
      └── binary_search/
```
