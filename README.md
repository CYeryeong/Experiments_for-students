# Experiments for Students

Welcome to the Experiments for Students repository! This is a collection of educational experiments and hands-on activities designed to help students learn programming, computer science, and related topics through practical exploration.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository provides:
- **Structured experiments** with clear objectives and procedures
- **Templates** to create your own experiments
- **Example code** demonstrating various concepts
- **Documentation** to guide both learners and contributors

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Students

1. **Browse the experiments**: Navigate to the `experiments/` directory to see available experiments
2. **Choose an experiment**: Start with the `example_experiment` to understand the structure
3. **Follow the instructions**: Each experiment has a README with detailed steps
4. **Learn and explore**: Modify the code, try variations, and deepen your understanding

### For Contributors

Want to add your own experiment? Check out our [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to:
- Create new experiments
- Use the experiment template
