# Example Experiment: Hello World Program

## Objective
Create a simple "Hello World" program to learn basic programming concepts.

## Background
"Hello World" is traditionally the first program written when learning a new programming language. It demonstrates the basic syntax of the language and verifies that your development environment is set up correctly.

## Materials
- A computer with a text editor
- Python 3.x installed (or any programming language of your choice)
- Terminal or command prompt

## Procedure
1. Open your text editor
2. Create a new file called `hello.py`
3. Type the following code:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
4. Save the file
5. Open your terminal/command prompt
6. Navigate to the directory containing your file
7. Run the program: `python hello.py`

## Expected Results
You should see the text "Hello, World!" printed to the console.

## Data Collection
Record the following:
- Did the program run successfully? (Yes/No)
- What output was displayed?
- Any error messages received?

## Analysis
- Verify that the output matches the expected result
- If errors occurred, identify what went wrong
- Understand the syntax used in the program

## Conclusions
This simple experiment demonstrates:
- How to write and run a basic program
- The structure of a simple Python script
- How to use the print function

## Questions
1. What does the `print()` function do?
2. Can you modify the program to print a different message?
3. What happens if you forget the quotation marks?
4. Why do we use `if __name__ == "__main__":` in the code?
5. How would you modify this program to print multiple lines?
6. Can you think of a real-world application where a simple output program like this would be useful?
